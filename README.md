# Water Profiles Project

This repository contains the dataset for the article A priori physical information to aid generalization capabilities of Neural Networks for hydraulic modeling.

## Overview

A set of water profiles were generated by uniformly varying $s$, $b$, $n$, $z_d$, and $Q$ within a specified range, solving equation \ref{energy equation} using a Finite-Difference scheme. The profiles are sampled with a fixed spatial discretization of $\Delta x$ set to 10 meters, covering a total length of 5000 m resulting in profiles of $N=501$ points.

## Dataset
